DESC:

temp.py: use $python3 temp.py to run, this file logs data from the two tempurature
    sensors in the spreadsheet linked above.
    
onewire.py: use $ ./onewire.py to run, simple reads the two temperature sensors and
        outputs the given data to the console
        

DISCLAIMER:
    Im only using 2 temperature sensors instead of the 3 given in the kit as I seemed
    to have misplaced one, I assumed this wasnt a huge deal as im still showing the same 
    general code expect I have 2 inputs instead of three.
