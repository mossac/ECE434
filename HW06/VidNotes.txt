(Beginning to about 12 minutes in)
1.	Where does Julia Cartwright work?
a.	National Instruments
2.	What is PREEMT_RT? Hint: Google it.
a.	It is the real time kernel patch
3.	What is mixed criticality?
a.	It is a when a embedded system is running both real time and non-real time applications that may need to coordinate 
4.	How can drivers misbehave?
a.	The driver stacks are stored between both RT and non-RT tasks
5.	What is Î” in Figure 1?
a.	Time in which an external event occurs and when its interrupt is run in software
6.	What is Cyclictest[2]?
a.	It just takes a time stamp, sleeps for a time then runs another time stamp and finds the time the system actually slept
7.	What is plotted in Figure 2?
a.	A system that is running the cyclictest on the same hardware both with RT and without RT
8.	What is dispatch latency? Scheduling latency?
a.	The time it takes software to be dispatched to hardware . The time it takes the scheduler to get the process to the CPU
9.	What is mainline?
a.	How traditional systems deal with real time events 
10.	What is keeping the External event in Figure 3 from starting?
a.	The longest running interrupt handler in the system 
11.	Why can the External event in Figure 4 start sooner?
a.	It forces IRQ threads through that wake up the handler threads
