Measuring a gpio pin answers:

3. 40ms off 
4. becasue the program is basing speed
6. .01 is the fastest i can get it to goes
7. not all that stable goes between 15.9Hz- 15.4Hz
8. even less stable as more computation power is being used
9. it makes it a bit shorter and more stable
10. yes it is shorter
11. .04 S
